# WELCOME TO MY PROFILE  
# About ME

* Myself Asish, Ph.D. student at Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. Currently, my primary research interest lies in solving biological problems by developing computational and statistical tools.

* I did my MS from Indian Institute of science education and research, Mohali where I launch into research. In my early days, I spent significant time in core biofields like developmental, cancer, Immuno and structural bio labs.

* Apart from these, I love to travel to remote places whenever I got some spare time.
